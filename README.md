# Promises
My first attempt at chaining multiple promises in JavaScript  
## Description  
Sometimes in asynchronous programming there are multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in certain order. Process of chaining promises together is called **composition**.  
## Testing  
Execute ```$ node app.js``` to run the project.
